DKMS is envisioned as a knowledge management system built with Drupal primarily for sharing/storing/searching case-related documents. Core functionality includes the ability to upload tagged and categorized documents using a single form; an intuitive search and filter system that allows advocates to quickly and easily locate the documents they need; mechanisms to identify the newest, most popular, or most helpful documents; and permissions controls so that limited access can be granted as necessary to outside individuals or organizations.


Dashboard

The "Dashboard" operates as the primary landing page for signed in users.

The top of the Dashboard includes a link to the user's account page, a link to the upload file form, a search box, and a mega menu that includes common filters (legal issue, document type, advocate author). These filters will operate using a Select2, allowing users to type or select their filter of choice (e.g. "eviction"). The search box returns results based on tags provided by users at the time the document was uploaded, as well as on the text of the document itself when possible.

Below this toolbar, the Dashboard will feature blocks highlighting (1) popular documents (e.g. 5-10 documents weighted by most unique user accesses then most overall accesses in the past 60 days); (2) recently uploaded documents; and (3) documents recently accessed by the current user.
